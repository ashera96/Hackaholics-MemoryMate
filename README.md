# Hackaholics-MemoryMate
An application to aid the Alzheimer's patients

### Project Introduction
This will allow Alzheimer's patients to keep all their day-to-day tasks in a well maintained manner. MemoryMate will give the ability to manually add a reminder or helper to add reminders into  the patient's timeline. Additionally we hope to gather random and forgotten reminders through the AI based question bank, where the user has to provide answers to the timely popups. We help the patient by reminding the stored events at the stored timeslots as push notifications.
